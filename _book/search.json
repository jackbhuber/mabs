    "text": "Abstract\nBackground. Since 2021, monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has effectively treated patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infections at risk of more severe infections. Clinical researchers have studied mAb effectiveness in reducing hospitalization and mortality. This study further examines the effectiveness of available mAb therapies in reducing rehospitalization and mortality over 19 months in the greater Seattle area.\nMethods. We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective chart review of nonhospitalized adult patients who presented to emergency departments (ED) in the greater Seattle area from March 2021-October 2022 with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infections. We compared mAbs treated patients to non-treated eligible patients with 28-day rehospitalization and all-cause hospital mortality as primary outcomes Secondary outcomes were rates of inpatient admission, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation. Propensity score matching and logistic regression models were used to control for demographic and comorbidities.\nResults. 21,139 patients were included. MAb treatment was associated with reduced significantly odds of 28-day rehospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.66, (95% CI 0.49-0.87), P = 0.004), mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.32, (95% CI 0.19-0.51), P &lt; 0.001), and inpatient admissions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.43, (95% CI 0.31-0.61), P &lt; 0.001).\nConclusions. In a single hospital system, From March 2021 through October 2022, mAbs treatments were associated with reduced rehospitalization, mortality, and inpatient admission in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infections in western Washington. Our study contributes real world evidence to the medical literature on the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies as a treatment for outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at risk of developing severe infection.\nKey Words comorbidities, COVID-19, mild-to-moderate, monoclonal antibody therapy, mortality, rehospitalization",

    "text": "Since early 2021, monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has emerged as an efficacious intervention for patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infections, particularly those at high risk of progressing to more severe infections. With favorable results from clinical trials, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations for a series of mAb treatments: casirivimab-imdevimab (REGEN-COV) in November 2020 [1,2], bamlanivimab plus etesevimab (BAM+ETE) in February 2021 [3,4], sotrovimab (SOT) in May 2021 [5,6], then bebtelovimab (BEB) in February 2022 [7,8]. As these therapeutic agents became readily available, clinicians and researchers embarked on comprehensive investigations into their impact on hospitalization rates and mortality outcomes. In spring 2021, bamlanivimab was associated with reduced rehospitalizations and, in most cases, mortality within 28 days [9–12]. Later, in the fall of 2021, sotrovimab use also seemed to decrease odds of hospitalization and mortality [13,14]. Later studies of bebtelovimab use, however, found mixed results [15,16].\nMore recent studies have examined the effect of all available mAb agents, along with COVID vaccinations, on patient outcomes over a longer period of the pandemic. These studies have also found decreased odds of rehospitalization and mortality in treated patients across phases of the pandemic [17,18].\nThis study delves deeper into the effectiveness of accessible mAb therapies and their synergistic interactions with COVID-19 vaccinations in mitigating rehospitalization and mortality over a span of 19 months, within the encompassing landscape of greater Seattle in western Washington.\n\n\n\n\n1.

This study was approved by the institutional review board of Providence-St. Joseph Health Care, a large multistate healthcare organization. Individual patient consent was not required. The setting for this study was Providence Swedish Health Services, a regional healthcare network in the Puget Sound area of western Washington which includes approximately 1,570 licensed beds. The network includes seven EDs that were host to 221,000 ED visits in 2022.\nWe identified a study population of adult patients who were eligible for monoclonal antibody therapy. Our inclusion criteria were adult outpatients who presented to an ED from March 25, 2021 (the date of the first mAb administration) through October 31, 2022, with mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infections and at least one of the following active comorbidities: arrythmia, cancer, cardiovascular dysfunction, diabetes, immunosuppression, obesity, renal dysfunction, a respiratory disorder, and/or tobacco use. We excluded patients who lacked all of the aforementioned comorbidities, who received oxygen therapy on their first ED visit, and who were admitted to the hospital on their first ED visit. Baseline demographic data we collected included age, sex, and race. We also collected acuity levels and dates of COVID-19 vaccinations.",

We operationalized this outcome as a dichotomy in which 1 indicated readmission to an ED or hospital within 28 days and 0 all others. Our second primary outcome of mortality we defined as all-cause hospital mortality, and this we measured as a dichotomy in which 1 indicated all-cause hospital mortality in the time between discharge from the ED visit and the end of the study period, and 0 all others. We defined a COVID-19-related reason as either (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 lab test undertaken within the hospital encounter, (2) a SARS-CoV-2 infection documented in the ED infectious risk screening, and/or (3) a COVID-19-related ED encounter diagnosis using ICD10 codes (U00, U09, U49, U50, U85, J12.82, M35.81, Z20.822). To account for historical change in the pandemic, we calculated the time in months from the date of the first mAb approval (November 21, 2020) to the date of the hospital encounter (whether an ED visit or inpatient admission). Because our secondary outcomes were skewed, we measured these as dichotomies in which 1 indicated any inpatient days, ICU days, and/or mechanical ventilation days, and 0 all others.\nOur covariates of interest included sex, race, age, comorbidities, mAb treatment status, acuity level, and number of vaccinations at the first ED visit. We coded sex as a dichotomy in which a value of 1 indicated male and 0 female, and race as a dichotomy in which 1 = nonwhite and 0 = white. We dichotomized age into patients below or at least 65 years of age at the time of the hospital encounter. For comorbidities we used ICD10 codes on the patient problem list. We coded each comorbidity as a dichotomy in which 1 indicated active presence within the study period and 0 nonpresence. We identified mAb-treated patients from documented administrations of mAb infusions on the first ED visit. Treatments included bamlanivimab, casirivimab + imdevimab, bamlanivimab + etesevimab, sotrovimab, and bebtelovimab. Acuity level we coded into the following 4-point ordinal scale of increasing urgency: 1 = Non-urgent, 2 = Less urgent, 3 = Urgent, 4 = Emergent or Immediate. Finally, we measured vaccination status as the cumulative count of documented COVID-19 vaccination dates received by the hospital encounter.",
